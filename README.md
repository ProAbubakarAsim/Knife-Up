## Knife Up – Physics-Based Arcade Game

Knife Up is a physics-based mobile arcade game developed in Unity.  
The game features a rotating circular wooden target with apples placed on it.  
Players tap the screen to throw knives upward, aiming to hit the apples while avoiding collisions with previously thrown knives.

The gameplay requires precise timing and accuracy, as incorrect throws result in failure.  
As the game progresses, the difficulty increases through faster rotation and complex apple placements.
